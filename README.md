# F(edusiv)editor

Feditor is GUI, SDL based fully keyboard controllable text editor.

I like neovim and vscode

I tired to make proper config for my neovim use

I like vscode but want to be this more arranged for my willings and needs

That's why I want to combine neovim and vscode:
* To have easy on-fly understandings how to use it.
* To have fully keyboard only control, but do not avoid mouse using as alternative sometimes.
* To have nice and understable configuration.

Currently I'm continuing to work on it and looking for nice contributors

## For building
You need to install sdllib:

sdl2

sdl2_ttf

On mac:
```
brew install sdl2
brew install sdl2_ttf
```
Project has cmake scripts to search for sdl libs.
